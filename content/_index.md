# Welcome

## Introduction

Welcome to **Docs Starter**. I'm a nice base project for markdown documentation forked from <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-book/" target="_blank">Hugo Book</a>.

Refer to [Quickstart Installation](/docs/quickstart/installation) to create documentation for your software.

## `content/_index.md` File

This example file serves as your documentation home page. Use it to write an *overview* about your software.

> Note: This contents of this home page file do not appear in search.

Use your subsequent files to provide the details and implementation steps for your software.

## Use Cases

Docs Starter is excellent for software that changes infrequently such as a narrow use-case internal tool. For such scenarios, Docs Starter excels at the following tasks:

- Serving as a scratchpad during development
- Serving as a quick installation guide or API reference post-development

## Limitations

Docs Starter is **not** optimized to be programmatically generated and updated alongside your changes to some underlying code base / repo. Therefore, it is **not** suitable for software that changes frequently or customer-facing products.

Secondly, the copy-paste functionality for code snippets is currently implemented by writing a `copyToClipboard` function in each file that contains code. This obviously does not scale.

## Additional Example

For an additional example file, refer to the dummy [Advanced Usage](/docs/advanced-usage) page.

# Quickstart

Providing markdown content in this file is optional. If excluded, clicking the "Quickstart" option in the table of contents simply collapses and expands the section.

## `content/**/_index.md` File

Use this file to write an *overview* about this section when needed. Then provide details and implementation steps in the section's files.

Notice this file is named `_index.md` which is the special designation in Hugo to denote that it is the "home page" of a section.

Further notice the weight in the Hugo "front" section of this file is `2`, so this section appears in the middle of the table of contents.

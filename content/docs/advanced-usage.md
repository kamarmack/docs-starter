# Advanced Usage

I'm an example piece of content about an advanced use case.

Notice the weight in the Hugo "front" section of this file is `3`, so it appears at the bottom of the table of contents, even though alphabetically it should be near the top.

## \*Insert Complicated Edge Case\*

Here's an unordered list of items to make this file feel markdown-y:

- Foo
- Bar
- FooBar
- BarFoo

## Further Questions

For additional support, contact **support@foo.bar**.
